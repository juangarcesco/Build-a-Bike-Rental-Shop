# Build-a-Bike-Rental-Shop

This script simulates a bike rental service where users can rent and return bikes. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database to track bike availability, customer information, and rental history. The main flow includes:

- Displaying a main menu.
- Allowing the user to rent or return bikes.
- Handling customer data (inserting new customers, updating rentals).
- Offering confirmation and error handling through recursive calls to the main menu.
